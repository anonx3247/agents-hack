Agent: Hi Alex! Today we're going to practice integrating x^2 from 0 to 1. Are you ready?
Student: I think so, but I'm not sure where to start.
Agent: No problem! What's the first thing you remember about integrating polynomials?
Student: I think I need to use the power rule, but I always get confused about the exponent.
Agent: Great! The power rule says to add one to the exponent and divide by the new exponent. What would that look like for x^2?
Student: So it would be x^3/3?
Agent: Exactly! Now, since this is a definite integral from 0 to 1, what do you do next?
Student: Plug in the limits?
Agent: Yes! Can you try plugging in the upper and lower limits and subtracting?
Student: Okay, so (1^3/3) - (0^3/3) = 1/3 - 0 = 1/3.
Agent: Perfect! You did it step by step. How do you feel about this process now?
Student: I think I get it better now, but I still worry about more complicated polynomials.
Agent: That's normal! We can practice more examples together. Would you like to try another one?
Student: Yes, please!
